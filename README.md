# Vue yFiles Component

This is a Vue 3 component that wraps the [yFiles](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles) graph visualization library. It implements [the generic graph visualization API of Qwiery](https://qwiery.com/graphviz/graphView) and thus allows an in-place replacement (betweeen Cytoscape, Ogma, yFiles and GoJs).

Note that yFiles is a commercial component and you need to [obtain a license](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-html/evaluate) to use it.

If you don't have a license you can use [the free Cytoscape version](https://qwiery.com/graphviz/cytoscape/). It implements the same API referred above.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @orbifold/vue-yfiles
```

and make sure you also have the yFiles library installed. You can [download it from the yWorks website](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-html/evaluate).

Assign the license via the `license` prop like so:

```html
<GraphViewer  :license="license"/>
```
The license looks like this:
```js
const license = {
    "company": "Your Corp",
    "date": "2021-09-01",
    "distribution": "global",
    "domains": [ "localhost"],
    "key": "your key",
    ...
```

See the demo application (`npm run dev`) for a complete example. 
 

## IGraphView

This wrapper implements the [Qwiery](https://qwiery.com) `IGraphView` interface and it means you can transparently exchange it with other implementations.
The [yFiles](https://github.com/Qwiery/qwiery-vue-yfiles) and [Linkurious Ogma](https://github.com/Qwiery/qwiery-vue-ogma) implementations are more advanced but are not free.

## Build and Testing

Clone the repo, install things (`npm i`). To build the library run `npm run build` and to test it run `npm run test`.

## Sample Application

You can run the sample application with `npm run dev` and then open `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever Vite shows in the console) in your browser.

If you include the [Qwiery Graph](https://github.com/Qwiery/qwiery-graphs) package (`npm i @orbifold/graphs`) you can use diverse graph generators to create graphs and then visualize them with this component.

For instance

```js
import { Graph } from "@orbifold/graphs";

const g = Graph.create("erdos");
const viewe = <IGraphView>viewer.value; //see snippet above
	viewer.loadGraph(g);
	viewer.layout(); //organica layout by default
```

# Graph structure

The `loadGraph` method expects a JSON graph:

```js

const g = {
	nodes: [
		{ id: 'a', name: 'A' },
		{ id: 'b', name: 'B' }
	],
	edges: [
		{ sourceId: 'a', targetId: 'b', name: 'A to B' },

	]
};
cy.loadGraph(g)
```

The `name` property is optional and will be used as the label of the node or edge.
The style of the graph defines whether the label is shown or not.

There are many different graph structures out there and if you wish to convert or use them, see the [Qwiery Graph](https://github.com/Qwiery/qwiery-graphs) package.
